.SH DESCRIPTION
scgi-cgi is a SCGI application to run normal cgi applications. It doesn't
make CGI applications faster, but it allows you to run them on a different
host and with different user permissions (without the need for suexec).
.P
For running you probably want spawn-fcgi (http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi)
.SH EXAMPLE
Example usage:

spawn-fcgi -n -s /var/run/scgi-cgi.sock -u www-default -U www-data -- /usr/bin/scgi-cgi
